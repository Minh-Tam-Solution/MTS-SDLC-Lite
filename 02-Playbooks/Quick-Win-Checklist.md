## 🎯 Week 1 Quick Wins (3-4 giờ total)

### Day 1 - Monday: Tool Audit (30 phút)

**Morning (15 phút)**
```
□ Open spreadsheet/Notion
□ List all AI tools team is using right now
  • Include: ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.
  • Don't include: Non-AI tools yet (focus laser)
□ For each tool, write 1-sentence purpose
```

**Afternoon (15 phút)**
```
□ Send quick Slack poll: "What AI tools are YOU using daily?"
□ Add any tools you missed
□ Total: Should have 5-15 tools listed
```

**✅ Success**: You now know what tools exist (many founders don't!)

---

### Day 2 - Tuesday: Owner & KPI Assignment (45 phút)

**Morning (30 phút)**
```
□ For each tool, assign:
  • Owner: Specific person (not "team")
  • KPI: What success looks like
  
□ Example format:
  Tool: ChatGPT
  Owner: [Your name]
  KPI: Generate 3 PRDs per week in <1 hour each
  Current: 2 PRDs per week, 2 hours each

□ Be honest with "Current" baseline - no judgment
```

**Afternoon (15 phút)**
```
□ Identify orphan tools:
  • No owner? → Mark for review
  • No KPI? → Mark for review
  • Not used in 2 weeks? → Mark for kill

□ Kill list: At least 20% of tools should be questionable
```

**✅ Success**: Every tool has owner + KPI or is marked for death.

---

### Day 3 - Wednesday: Pick Your Battle (30 phút)

**Pick 1 small use case to optimize with 4-stage framework:**

```
Criteria (all must be YES):
□ Small: Can complete in 2 weeks or less
□ Frequent: Team does this 3+ times per week  
□ Painful: Everyone groans when this comes up
□ Measurable: Can track time or quality
□ Repeatable: Will do again and again

Examples of GOOD first battles:
✅ "Idea → Initial PRD draft" 
✅ "Bug report → Root cause doc"
✅ "Feature request → Technical spec"
✅ "Meeting notes → Action items"

Examples of BAD first battles:
❌ "Entire product development process" (too big)
❌ "Yearly strategic planning" (not frequent)
❌ "One-off migration project" (not repeatable)
```

**Write down your choice:**
```
My Use Case: _________________________________

Why this one:
- Small because: ___________________________
- Frequent because: ________________________
- Painful because: _________________________
- Measurable because: ______________________
```

**✅ Success**: You have 1 concrete use case, not "improve everything."

---

### Day 4 - Thursday: 4-Stage Quick Map (1 giờ)

**Map your use case through WHY/WHAT/HOW/BUILD:**

```
Use Case: [Your chosen battle]

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 00. WHY? (5 phút)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Problem: ___________________________  │
│ • Matters because: ____________________  │
│ • AI can help by: _____________________  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 01. WHAT? (10 phút)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Outcome: ____________________________  │
│ • Success = ___________________________  │
│ • Target time: ________________________  │
│ • Target quality: (1-10) ___           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 02. HOW? (30 phút)                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Step 1: [Action] - [Human or AI?]       │
│ Step 2: [Action] - [Human or AI?]       │
│ Step 3: [Action] - [Human or AI?]       │
│ ...                                      │
│                                         │
│ Quality Gate 1: [After step X, check Y] │
│ Quality Gate 2: [After step Z, check W] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 03. BUILD (15 phút)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Primary AI tool: ____________________  │
│ • Secondary tool (optional): __________  │
│ • Test plan: Do it 3 times this week    │
│ • Track: Time + Quality (1-10 rating)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pro Tip**: Don't overthink. Rough draft OK. You'll refine.

**✅ Success**: 1-page map exists. Concrete steps visible.

---

### Day 5 - Friday: First Experiment Run (1 giờ)

**Do your use case ONCE following the map:**

```
Before you start:
□ Note current time: ___________
□ Have your 4-stage map open
□ Have your AI tool(s) ready

During:
□ Follow the steps in HOW section
□ Note where you get stuck (be honest!)
□ Note where AI helps vs doesn't help
□ Check quality gates (did you pass?)

After completion:
□ End time: ___________
□ Total time: ___________ 
□ Quality self-rating (1-10): ___
□ What worked well: _______________
□ What needs fixing: _______________
```

**Compare to your usual way:**
```
USUAL WAY:
  Time: _____ | Quality: _____

NEW WAY (4-stage):
  Time: _____ | Quality: _____

Difference: ___% faster / slower
            ___% better / worse quality
```

**🎯 Target**: Even if slower this first time, you learned. Next time will be faster.

**✅ Success**: 1 iteration done. Data collected. Learnings captured.

## 💰 ROI Calculator (Napkin Math)

**Your use case frequency**: ___ times per week

**Time saved per instance**: ___ minutes

**Team size**: ___ people

```
Weekly savings = [frequency] × [time saved] × [team size]
Monthly savings = Weekly × 4
Yearly savings = Monthly × 12

Example:
Use case: Idea → PRD draft
Frequency: 3x per week
Time saved: 30 min per PRD
Team size: 5 people

Weekly: 3 × 30min × 5 = 450 min = 7.5 hours
Monthly: 7.5 × 4 = 30 hours
Yearly: 30 × 12 = 360 hours = 9 work weeks saved!
```

**Your numbers:**
```
Weekly savings: _____ hours
Monthly savings: _____ hours  
Yearly savings: _____ hours = _____ weeks
```

**At average salary $50/hour:**
```
Yearly value = [hours saved] × $50 = $_______
```

**👀 This is from ONE use case. Imagine 5-10 patterns...**

## 🚫 If You're Stuck - Troubleshooting

### "I don't have 3-4 hours this week"
**Solution**: 
- Day 1: 15 phút during lunch
- Day 2: 20 phút before standup  
- Day 3: 15 phút after dinner
- Day 4: 30 phút morning focus time
- Day 5: 1 hour block (ask for it)

**Total: Distributed across the week, not a big block.**

---

### "My use case is taking longer, not shorter"
**Expected!** 
- First time: Slower (learning framework)
- Second time: Back to baseline
- Third time: 10-20% faster
- Fifth time: 30-50% faster

**Fix**: Stick with it for 5 iterations before judging.

---

### "AI tools aren't helping"
**Diagnose**:
- Are you giving AI enough context?
  → Try: "Based on 4-stage map, help me with Step X"
- Are you using right tool for task?
  → Ideation = ChatGPT/Gemini
  → Implementation = Claude/Copilot
- Are quality gates catching AI mistakes?
  → If not, add a human check step

---

### "Team doesn't care"
**Don't need full buy-in yet.**
- Start solo
- Prove it works for YOU first
- Share results after 2 weeks
- Let success speak

**"Demo > Pitch"** always wins.

---

## 🎯 Success Looks Like...

**After Week 1:**
